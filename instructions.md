# Instructions for Building and Deploying Kivy App to iOS

## Preliminary Steps
Before starting, ensure Git and Homebrew are installed on your system:

### Install Git
If Git is not installed, you can install it using Homebrew:
```
brew install git
```

### Install Homebrew
If Homebrew is not installed, run:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Cloning the Repository
Clone the GitHub repository containing the Kivy project:
```
git clone https://github.com/010Mak/catch-cornish_iPhone_app
cd catch-cornish_iPhone_app
```

## Install Python
Kivy requires Python. Install it using Homebrew:
```
brew install python3
```

## Install Kivy and Dependencies
```
python3 -m pip install kivy
```

## Install Buildozer
Buildozer is a tool for packaging Kivy apps for different platforms, including iOS.
```
python3 -m pip install buildozer
```

## Install Xcode
Install Xcode from the Mac App Store for iOS development.

## Set Up Buildozer for iOS Packaging
Navigate to your project directory and create a `buildozer.spec` file:
```
cd path/to/your/project
buildozer init
```
Edit the `buildozer.spec` file for your iOS app settings.

## Install Buildozer Dependencies for iOS
```
brew install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
```

## Build the iOS App
Build your app for iOS:
```
buildozer -v ios debug deploy run
```

## Open the Xcode Project
The Xcode project will be in `.buildozer/ios/platform/yourappname-ios`. Open this in Xcode.

## Configure and Test in Xcode
Configure your app settings in Xcode and test with the iOS Simulator or a device.

## Prepare for App Store Submission
Ensure your app meets Apple's App Store guidelines and set up an App Store Connect account.

## Archive and Submit Your App
Archive your app in Xcode and submit it to the App Store via App Store Connect.

## Wait for Review
After submission, wait for Apple to review your app.

**Note:**
- You'll need an Apple Developer account to submit apps to the App Store.
- Consult Kivy, Buildozer, and Apple's documentation for specific instructions.
