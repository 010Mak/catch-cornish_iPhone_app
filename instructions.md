### 1. Clone Your Repository on the MacBook
First, clone your GitHub repository containing the Kivy project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/010Mak/catch-cornish_iPhone_app.git
cd catch-cornish_iPhone_app
```
Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git` with your repository's URL.

### 2. Install Homebrew (If Not Installed)
Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that you'll use to install Python and other dependencies.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 3. Install Python
Kivy requires Python. Install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install python3
```

### 4. Install Kivy and Dependencies
Install Kivy and its dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install kivy
```

### 5. Install Buildozer
Buildozer is a tool for packaging Kivy apps for different platforms, including iOS.

```bash
python3 -m pip install buildozer
```

### 6. Install Xcode
Xcode is required for iOS development. Install it from the Mac App Store.

### 7. Set Up Buildozer for iOS Packaging
Navigate to your project directory and create a `buildozer.spec` file:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
buildozer init
```

Edit the `buildozer.spec` file to configure settings for your iOS app, like package name, version, etc.

### 8. Install Buildozer Dependencies for iOS
Install required tools using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
```

### 9. Build the iOS App
Use Buildozer to build your app for iOS:

```bash
buildozer -v ios debug deploy run
```

### 10. Open the Xcode Project
Buildozer will create an Xcode project in `.buildozer/ios/platform/yourappname-ios`. Open this project in Xcode.

### 11. Configure and Test in Xcode
In Xcode, configure your app's settings, such as its bundle identifier, version, icons, etc. Test the app using the iOS Simulator or a connected iOS device.

### 12. Prepare for App Store Submission
Ensure your app meets Apple's App Store guidelines. Create an App Store Connect account and fill in all necessary information like app description, screenshots, etc.

### 13. Archive and Submit Your App
In Xcode, archive your app and submit it to the App Store via App Store Connect.

### 14. Wait for Review
After submission, wait for Apple to review your app. This process can take a few days to a week.

### Note:
- **Apple Developer Account**: To submit apps to the App Store, you'll need an Apple Developer account, which requires an annual subscription fee.
- **Complex Process**: This is a high-level overview. Each step, especially app configuration in Xcode and submission to the App Store, can involve detailed sub-steps.

Ensure to frequently consult Kivy, Buildozer, and Apple's official documentation for specific instructions and troubleshooting.
